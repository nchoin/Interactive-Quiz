# Interactive-Quiz
This is a quiz focusing on the DDC, Dewey Decimal Classification. It will include questions related to call numbers and topics in the DDC as well as the person who created the DDC system. The format includes multiple choice and true and false questions as well as a timer and score keeper.
/*Ideas for how to make the quiz - what pieces do I need to make:
1. I need to make a timer with a start button. My timer starts when page loads and I need it to start with button...How do I do this? Need to make incorrect answers TAKE AWAY time as a penalty.
2. The button should trigger two events
    a. the timer to begin
    b. the "unveiling" of the first question and answer set - already does this.âœ…

Still need to do 1 and 2a. Also need to Clear fields when high score is submitted. 




3. Need to create a set of questions/answers. 
    a. Was thinking I could give the Q/A a class so I could then create a variable named questionAnswerArr[]. Within this array, I would have an object {}for each "collection" of questions/options[]/correct choice.
    b. if all the QA are in an array then I could create a for loop for each index to be visible and the rest hidden. Connect this to a continue or next button 
        for(var i = 0; i < questionAnswerArr.length; i++) {
            blah blah something...
            } else {
                confirm(You're done)
        }
    c. I could set the length of the for loop to be questionAnswerArr.length 
    d. Would I then be able to apply a Math.random for the Q/A to go in random order?
    e. was thinking each Q/A would be its own UL with the question being a li and each answer an li.

4. I need to identify the correct answer to increase the score. That would probably be a button/event. Would each answer have to be a button or could a make each a link but would the answers link to???Hmmm.
    a. can you assign 2 classes to an element? Yes I can https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/CSS_FAQ example  <li class="qa correct">The text of the correct answer</li> 

    Could I create a class for just the correct answers and then connect the increment of the score to the correct button? Would I make a variable correctAnswer = document.getElementsbyClass("correct"); 
    Then an if statement - if (not sure what I'd write here) { score = score++} hmmmm

5. Ideas for "class" names I'll need to define in CSS and attached in HTML and JS:
    timer - to add styles to the HTML
    scoreboard - to add styles to the HTML
    qa - the class for all question and answers. (would I apply to UL or li? if apply to UL would it include the li?) need to review that
    correct - for correct li choices
