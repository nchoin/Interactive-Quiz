# Interactive-Quiz
This is a quiz focusing on the DDC, Dewey Decimal Classification. It includes questions related to call numbers and topics in the DDC as well as the person who created the DDC system. The format includes multiple choice questions as well as a timer and score keeper. If the quiz taker is unfamiliar with the DDC, I've included a link to a Google SlideShow which includes information about the creator of the DDC as well as descriptons about the organization and categories.   

## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
As a librarian, part of the core curriculum is helping students became independent library patrons. To be independent, one must understand how the nonfiction - mostly informative text - is organized. Once a student knows the basic categories and number connections, he/she can find any topic. I wanted to create a quick quiz about the DDC so other librarians could use it with their classes.  

I learned a how to use arrays to store objects and which operate like a database for the questions. I learned how to denote the correct answers and use JS to search for the correct responses and create a score sheet. I also learned how to append the information in the array by added a class which would then change the CSS to indicate if a choice was correct or incorrect. I also learned how to use JS to change the CSS style.display.

On the Stats page, the information is sent to local storage. There is no leaderboard at this time. Possible in a future version. Once the stats are posted, the page refreshes, clearing out the labels.

Thank you to Avinash, manager of the YouTube channel named [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev/about) @GreatStackDev. He shared his approach to [creating a quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8) .His instruction gave me the language I needed to create the quiz I envisioned. I had the pieces and he helped me put them together and execute them. I found his explanation for appending elements and the css extremely helpful in creating my quiz. His instructions and explanations were very clear, explaining the why and the how. I followed his ideas for using color (appending css styles) to indicate correct and incorrect answers as well. I followed his instruction to set up functions to extract information from the QA array to display on the screen.The tutorial I followed is listed below as well as a link the YouTube Channel.  


For the final step of the quiz, I wanted to the clear the inputs by refreshing the screen. I found this resource from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-refresh-page-how-to-reload-a-page-in-js/) and used the information to improve the coding.   


This is a link to my [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=create+a+quiz+javascript&oq=creating+a+quiz+jav&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgBEAAYFhgeMgYIABBFGDkyCAgBEAAYFhgeMggIAhAAGBYYHjIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMgoICBAAGIYDGIoFMgoICRAAGIYDGIoF0gEIOTUxMWoxajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I reviewed many of the results to find an approach that was similar to my thought process.
